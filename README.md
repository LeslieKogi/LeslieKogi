Iâ€™m a software developer with a strong passion for frontend web development. I completed the Foundation class in Software Engineering at Moringa School and am currently advancing through the full bootcamp. Right now, Iâ€™m focused on sharpening my frontend skills and building interactive, user-centered applications.
